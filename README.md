# Herediscope 

Herediscope is a project done by our team at ArchHacks, a Hackathon hosted at WashU. Credit also goes to Jon Jon, David, and Peter. 

Herediscope is an an app that uses simple Mendelian genetics to predict the liklihood that the users themselves have a hereditary disease or what traits/diseases their children (with the information of the chosen partner) could have. After a series of questions regarding whether the parents have that specific disease or not and if the user knows, homozygous or heterozygous, the app will display a rough percentage.

Features: 
- "You" page is for the users themselves to see the probability of having a specific disease
- "Child" page is for users to see what traits their children will likely show 
- "Reference" page is a list of common genetic disorders and diseases that users can learn more about. Mostly sourced from Mayo Clinic

Notes: 
- We read and displayed information from JSON files
- Ideally, we would have a database that we could fetch from rather than manually entering the data in a JSON file. 
- Also we used very simple Mendelian rules, but with more time and biology knowledge, the app preferably would use a more complex algorithm to more accurately deduce probability.
